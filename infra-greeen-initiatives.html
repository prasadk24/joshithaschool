                        <div>At Joshitha, students regularly interact with our fresh, green garden spaces. The free area in school has been efficiently used to plant various crops, including sustainably maintained papaya, tamarind, bananas, guavas and a large
                            variety of flowering plants, allowing students to observe a variety of plants in the same environment. These plants are also neatly tagged with their common name and botanical name, allowing our students to relate what they
                            see with their classroom learning.

                        <h4>STUDENT PARTICIPATION</h4>
                        <div>Students are also encouraged to actively participate in maintaining our school garden, by allowing them to plant crops, think of innovative ways to plant plants in recyclable material like old tires or plastic bottles, and also
                            encourage their peers and juniors to be more aware of their environment and will them to participate in keeping their school clean and green.

                        <hr>
                        <div>Moreover, green spaces tend to attract various butterflies and birds, allowing our students to observe this ecosystem and stay connected with nature. Having a green environment in school helps keep both our teachers and students
                            to keep a fresh mind and stay active.
