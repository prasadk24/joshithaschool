                <h2>A word by the Director</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>In the twenty first century we are facing a society, where knowledge is at the pivotal place. Knowledge to develop cognitive, intellectual, emotional and physical aspect of pupils. A development which would make leaders in their own chosen
                    fields. Technology is the making, usage and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques to solve a problem. Technology has affected society and its surroundings in a number of ways. There is no doubt technology has become heavily integrated
                    into our everyday lives.</p>
                <p>At Joshitha, I have made every attempt to integrate technology in classrooms. Here the skills and learning is put to practical use. The delivery of the knowledge through technological mediums is in a much more interactive and creative
                    manner resulting in a shift from ‘memorize to understanding’.</p>
                <p>I also believe in raising the children to be leaders but not followers. The curriculum is designed to develop the leadership skills, giving children the vision and skill sets to see opportunities and to embrace the challenges of life with
                    optimism.
                </p>
